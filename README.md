## Overview

This project provides a set of reinforcement learning environments for Unitree robots, built on top of [IsaacLab](https://github.com/isaac-sim/IsaacLab).

Currently supports Unitree **Go2**, **H1** and **G1-29dof** robots.

## Installation

- Install Isaac Lab by following the [installation guide](https://isaac-sim.github.io/IsaacLab/main/source/setup/installation/index.html).
- Install the Unitree RL IsaacLab standalone environments.
    - Clone or copy this repository separately from the Isaac Lab installation (i.e. outside the `IsaacLab` directory):
        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/unitreerobotics/unitree_rl_lab.git
        ```

    - Use a python interpreter that has Isaac Lab installed, install the library in editable mode using:
        ```bash
        conda activate env_isaaclab
        python -m pip install -e source/unitree_rl_lab
        ```
- Download unitree usd files
    - Download unitree usd files from [unitree_model](https://github.com/unitreerobotics/unitree_model), keeping folder structure

    - Config 'UNITREE_MODEL_DIR' in 'source/unitree_rl_lab/unitree_rl_lab/assets/robots/unitree.py'.
        ```bash
        UNITREE_MODEL_DIR = "</home/user/projects/unitree_usd>"
        ```

- Verify that the environments are correctly installed by:

    - Listing the available tasks:

        ```bash
        python scripts/list_envs.py
        ```

    - Running a task:

        ```bash
        python scripts/rsl_rl/train.py --headless --task Unitree-G1-29dof-Velocity
        ```

    - Inference with a trained agent:

        ```bash
        python scripts/rsl_rl/play.py --task Unitree-G1-29dof-Velocity-Play
        ```

## Deploy

After the model training is completed, we need to perform sim2sim on the trained strategy in Mujoco to test the performance of the model.
Then deploy sim2real.

### Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies
sudo apt install -y libyaml-cpp-dev libboost-all-dev libeigen3-dev
# Install unitree_sdk2
git clone git@github.com:unitreerobotics/unitree_sdk2.git
cd unitree_sdk2
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -DBUILD_EXAMPLES=OFF # Install on the /usr/local directory
sudo make install
# Compile the robot_controller
cd deploy/robots/g1 # or other robots
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. && make
```

### Sim2Sim

Installing the [unitree_mujoco](https://github.com/unitreerobotics/unitree_mujoco?tab=readme-ov-file#installation).

- Set the `robot` at `/simulate/config.yaml` to g1
- Set `domain_id` to 0
- Set `enable_elastic_hand` to 1
- Set `use_joystck` to 1.

```bash
# start simulation
cd unitree_mujoco/simulate/build
./unitree_mujoco
```

```bash
cd unitree_rl_lab/deploy/robots/g1/build
./g1_ctrl
# 1. press [L2 + Up] to set the robot to stand up
# 2. Click the mujoco window, and then press 8 to make the robot feet touch the ground.
# 3. Press [R1 + X] to run the policy.
# 4. Click the mujoco window, and then press 9 to disable the elastic band.
```

### Sim2Real

You can use this program to control the robot directly, but make sure the on-borad control program has been closed.

```bash
./g1_ctrl --network eth0 # eth0 is the network interface name. 
```
